<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming application. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the application, as well as a directory with JSON meta-data on the songs in their application.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. The role of this project is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. 

### Project Description

In this project, we will model the data with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. The fact and dimension tables for a star database schema for a particular analytic focus is defined, and an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL was developed.

### Built With

* python
* PostgreSQL
* iPython notebooks


### Dataset
#### Song Dataset
Songs dataset is a subset of [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/).  Each file in the dataset is in JSON format and contains meta-data about a song and the artist of that song. 

Sample Record :
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

#### Log Dataset
Logs dataset is generated by [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim).  These log files in JSON format simulate activity logs from a music streaming application based on specified configurations.

Sample Record :
```
{"artist": null, "auth": "Logged In", "firstName": "Walter", "gender": "M", "itemInSession": 0, "lastName": "Frye", "length": null, "level": "free", "location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA", "method": "GET","page": "Home", "registration": 1540919166796.0, "sessionId": 38, "song": null, "status": 200, "ts": 1541105830796, "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"", "userId": "39"}
```


## Database Schema Design

### Data Model ERD

The Star Database Schema used for data modeling in this ETL pipeline. There is one fact table containing all the metrics (facts) associated to each event (user actions), and four dimensions tables, containing associated information such as user name, artist name, song meta-data etc. This model enables to search the database schema with the minimum number of  *SQL JOIN*s possible and enable fast read queries. The amount of data we need to analyze is not big enough to require big data solutions or NoSQL databases.

An entity relationship diagram (ERD) of the data model is given below.

##Project Repository files
Python files .py :

1)  sql_queries.py : python file have all creation / insertion queries for creating tables in database and insert data from files
2) create_tables.py : python script drops all tables if exist and recreate it
3) etl.py : python script preform ETL operation(extract from json file ,transafer data to proper format ,load data in tables) for all files in data.zip

###Python notebook files .ipynb :

1) etl.ipynb : demonstrates ETL process step by step to check data extraction and format changing
2) Run.ipynb : to execute project by run create_tables.py then etl.py
3)test.ipynb : to test the content of database tables
Other files :

1) data.zip : data compressed file for log_files & song_files
2) dend-p1-lessons-cheat-sheet.pdf : very helpful cheat sheet to recap most of project functions and modules

###How To Run the Project
1) Way 1 : to run all cells in Run.ipynb
2) Way 2 : to execute the following python commands from terminal
python3 create_tables.py
python3 etl.py
